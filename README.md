# Twitter Engagement Cross-Cultural Analysis

This study aims to investigate and perform a cross-cultural analysis of various Twitter datasets encom- passing French celebrities, French politicians, US politicians, US celebrities, and a random sample set. The objective is to identify key factors that influence high engagement rates, quantified through likes, quotes, retweets, and impression counts. The steps undertaken include data acquisition from Twitter, followed by comprehensive data exploration and visualisation. A bespoke pipeline was developed to facilitate regression analysis and to identify the most relevant features that contribute to heightened engagement. The findings from this study will shed light on the efficacy of platform amplification in social media posts, particularly in varying cultural and public figure contexts. The study underscores the importance of understanding the unique characteristics of different audiences and stakeholders, promoting tailored and effective communication strategies in the ever-evolving landscape of social media.

## Objective

The primary objective of this research is to determine which quantifiable attributes of a tweet, and the associated Twitter profile, most significantly correlate with high user engagement rates within the contexts of French and American public figures. 

## Data 

Data for this research was derived from the public Twitter API, employing the command-line tool Twarc for extraction.
Given the potential for regional variances in subsequent observations, the data was segmented into distinct subsets. This study emphasized two categories of individuals typically boasting a high follower count and interaction rate on Twit- ter: politicians and celebrities. Recognizing the potential for cultural influences on engagement, these groups were further separated into French and American subsets. This bifurcation allowed for an in-depth exploration of regional differences that could potentially impact Twitter engagement patterns.
